This C++ project involves working with arithmetic expressions. It includes the following main components:

-  arithmeticExpression.h and arithmeticExpression.cpp: These files define a class called arithmeticExpression for handling arithmetic expressions. The class includes methods for building an expression tree from an infix expression, converting expressions between infix, prefix, and postfix notations, and visualizing the expression tree.

-  TreeNode Struct: Inside arithmeticExpression.h, there is a TreeNode struct that represents the nodes of the expression tree. Each node contains data, a key, and pointers to left and right children.

-  arithmeticExpression Class: The arithmeticExpression class takes an infix expression as input and builds a corresponding expression tree. It provides methods to convert and display expressions in infix, prefix, and postfix notations. Additionally, it allows you to visualize the expression tree.

-  main.cpp: The main program demonstrates the usage of the arithmeticExpression class by creating instances with different infix expressions, building their expression trees, and displaying the expressions in various notations.

Overall, this project focuses on parsing and manipulating arithmetic expressions, which can be helpful for mathematical calculations or expression evaluation tasks.
